# EngineeringDesignIII
This repository contains the project that James Paetkau and I worked on this year in Engineering Design III (Fall 2018).
The program communicates with a Nextion touch screen and utilizes a lock screen interface. An Arduino Uno was used and simple pressure sensor circuit was implemented:

The eamil program is in the preliminary stages of working. The idea is to integrate a communication system over gmail so that if an individual unlocks the touch screen then the owner gets notified.
